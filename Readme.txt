The main function is in the file "chess.py", so run that one. The other files are necessary.
Because this uses ascii art, it is recommended to run it in IDLE. Running it using other apps may not give enough room to show the art.
Most of the ascii art came from this website: https://ascii.co.uk/art/chess
Please don't be too mean to the AI, he's not very bright :(
